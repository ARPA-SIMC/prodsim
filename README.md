Prodsim is a collection of shell scripts and Fortran programs based on
[libsim](https://github.com/ARPA-SIMC/libsim).

It is designed for processing raw numerical weather prediction (NWP)
model output data and perform physically-based operations in order to
obtain postprocessed data to be used e.g. for:

 * generation of customized weather forecast products
 * verification of NWP model output
